# Working with Custom Identity User

AuthEndpoints works only with IdentityUser. For AuthEndpoints to work with custom identity user,
you need to specify the key type for `TUserKey` and the custom user class for `TUser` on `AddAuthEndpoints<TUserKey, TUser>()`.
For example, my custom identity user:

```cs
public class MyApplicationUser : IdentityUser<Guid>
{
  public string Nickname { get; set; }
}
```

Then, you can simply specify the key type for `TUserKey` and the custom class for `TUser`:

```cs
services.AddAuthEndpoints<Guid, MyApplicationUser>();
```
