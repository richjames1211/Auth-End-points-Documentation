# AuthEndpoints
AuthEndpoints library provides a set of Web API controllers to handle basic & JWT authentication actions such as registration, login, refresh, verify, and logout. It works with [custom identity user model](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/authentication/customize-identity-model?view=aspnetcore-6.0#model-generic-types). The purpose of this project is to make developers life easier (prevents you from balding) and more productive.
